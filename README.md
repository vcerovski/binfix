# BINFIX

Viktor Cerovski, Sep 2015.

<a name="Introduction"></a>
## Introduction

BINFIX (blend from "Binary Infix") is a poweful infix syntax notation for
S-expressions of Common LISP.  There are many packages that do something similar,
and BINFIX differs from them in the sheer scope of the offered infix operations
with numerous capabilities:

* Infix arithmetic operations, comparisons, logical connectives, etc
* Simple notation for lambda lists including optional arguments
* Simpler `LET`s and assignments
* Simpler multiple-choice forms
* Explicit annotation of types in lambda lists and `LET`s
* Overall reduction of the number of parens in definitions.

<a name="Instalation"></a>
## Instalation

[Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/) makes the downloading/installation/loading
trivial:

    (ql:quickload :binfix)

After loading the package, the next step is to allow use of its symbols

    (use-package :binfix)

BINFIX is developed using
[SBCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Bank_Common_Lisp), and checked to
work fine with [CLISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLISP),
and [Clozure CL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozure_CL),
while with [ECL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embeddable_Common_Lisp) BINFIX
passes tests when hand-loaded but does not go through the package system yet.

BINFIX shadows `!` in CLISP (`ext:!`) and `@` in Clozure CL and ECL.

<a name="Examples"></a>
## Examples

Generally, quoting a BINFIX expression in REPL will produce the corresponding
S-expression.

For easier comparison of input and output forms in following examples, LISP
printer is first `setq` (operation `=.`) to lowercase output with

    {*print-case* =. :downcase}

=> `:downcase`


<a name="Arithmetic and logical expressions"></a>
### Arithmetic and logical expressions

Classic math stuff:

    {2 * 3 + 4}

=> `10`

    '{a * {b + c}}

=> `(* a (+ b c))`

    '{- {x + y} / x * y}

=> `(- (/ (+ x y) (* x y)))`

    '{0 < x < 1 && y >= 1 || y >= 2}

=> `(or (and (< 0 x 1) (>= y 1)) (>= y 2))`

Expressions like `{(f x y) * (g a b)}` and `{{f x y} * {g a b}}` generally
produce the same result. The inner brackets, however, can be removed:

    '{sqrt x * sin x}

=> `(* (sqrt x) (sin x))`

    '{A ! i .= B ! j + C ! k}

=> `(setf (aref a i) (+ (aref b j) (aref c k)))`

    '{a ! i j += b ! i k * c ! k j}

=> `(incf (aref a i j) (* (aref b i k) (aref c k j)))`

    '{listp A && car A == 'x && cdr A || A}

=> `(or (and (listp a) (eql (car a) 'x) (cdr x)) a)`

    {cons -2 loop for i to 9 collect i}

=> `(-2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)`

<a name="Lambdas, definitions and type annotations"></a>
### Lambdas, definitions and type annotations

<a name="lambda"></a>
#### `lambda`

    '{x -> sqrt x * sin x}

=> `(lambda (x) (* (sqrt x) (sin x)))`

    '{x :single-float -> sqrt x * sin x}

=> `(lambda (x) (declare (type single-float x)) (* (sqrt x) (sin x)))`

    '{x y -> {x - y}/{x + y}}

=> `(lambda (x y) (/ (- x y) (+ x y)))`

Mixing of notations works as well, so each of the following

    {x y -> / (- x y) (+ x y)}
    {x y -> (- x y)/(+ x y)}
    {x y -> (/ (- x y) (+ x y))}

produces the same form.

Fancy way of writing `{2 * 3 + 4}`

    {{x -> y -> z -> x * y + z} @ 2 @ 3 @ 4}

=> `10`

Quoting reveals the expanded S-expr

    '{{x -> y -> z -> x * y + z} @ 2 @ 3 @ 4}

=>

    (funcall (funcall (funcall
      (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) (+ (* x y) z))))
        2) 3) 4)

Indeed, `@` is left-associative, standing for `funcall`.

More complicated types can be also explicitely given after the
argument, 

    '{x :|or symbol number| -> cons x x}

=>

    (lambda (x) (declare (type (or symbol keyword) x)) (cons x x))


<a name="defun"></a>
#### `defun`

Factorial fun:

    '{f n :integer := if {n <= 0} 1 {n * f {1- n}}}

=>

    (defun f (n)
      (declare (type integer n))
      (if (<= n 0)
          1
          (* n (f (1- n)))))

<a name="&optional"></a>
#### `&optional` is optional

Explicitely tail-recursive version of `f`

    '{fac n m = 1 :=
       declare (integer m n)
       if {n <= 0} m
          {fac {n - 1} {n * m}}}

=>

    (defun fac (n &optional (m 1))
      (declare (integer m n))
      (if (<= n 0)
          m
          (fac (- n 1) (* n m))))

As you may by now expect, the following is also permited

    {fac n :integer m :integer = 1 :=
      if {n <= 0} m
         {fac {n - 1} {n * m}}}

<a name="defmethod"></a>
#### `defmethod`

Generic versions of `f`

    '{f n :integer :- if {n <= 0} 1 {n * f {1- n}}}
    '{f (n integer):- if {n <= 0} 1 {n * f {1- n}}}

both produce

    (defmethod f ((n integer))
      (if (<= n 0)
          1
          (* n (f (1- n)))))

<a name="defmacro"></a>
#### `defmacro`

Macros are defined via `:==` operation, similar to the previous examples.
See Sec. [Support for macros](#Support for macros).

<a name="Type function"></a>
#### Type `function`

Operation `:->` can be used to specify function type. For example, in
SBCL 1.1.17 function `sin` has declared type that can be written as

    '{number :-> single-float -1.0 1.0 ||
                 double-float -1.0 1.0 ||
                 complex single-float  ||
                 complex double-float .x. &optional}

=>

    (function (number)
     (values
      (or (single-float -1.0 1.0)
          (double-float -1.0 1.0)
          (complex single-float)
          (complex double-float))
      &optional))

<a name="LETs"></a>
### LETs

Various `let` forms currently covered by BINFIX all follow the pattern
of 

    '{let x bit = 1
          y = 2
        {x + y}}

=>

    (let ((x 1) (y 2))
      (declare (type bit x))
      (+ x y))

`flet`/`labels` forms require name and lambda-list before `:=` symbol:

    '{flet f x := {sqrt x * sin x}
        (f 0.5)}

=>

    (flet ((f (x)
             (* (sqrt x) (sin x))))
      (f 0.5))

<a name="Implicit/Explicit progn"></a>
### Implicit/Explicit `progn`

Lambda written in BINFIX has no implicit progn (a nod to purely functional
programming,) while `let`s have it.  This in particular means that if a prog is
needed in the body of lambda, it should be explicitely given:

    {x -> prog2 (format t "Calculating... ")
                {f $ x * x}
                (format t "done.~%")}

<a name="`$`plitter"></a>
### `$`plitter

Infix `$` is a vanishing OP, leaving only its arguments,
effectivelly splitting the list in two parts.

    '{f $ g $ h x y z}

=> `(f (g (h x y z)))`

So its effect here is similar to `$` in Haskell. 
Or perphaps:

    '{declare $ optimize (speed 1) (safety 1)}

=> `(declare (optimize (speed 1) (safety 1)))`


`$`plitter also allows writing a shorter `cond`, as in

    (cond {p x $ f x}
          {q x $ g x}
          {r x $ h x}
          {t $ x})

compared to the equivalent

    (cond ((p x) (f x))
          ((q x) (g x))
          ((r x) (h x))
          (t x))

Another splitter is `?`, as described in the next section.

<a name="Multiple-choice forms"></a>
### Multiple-choice forms (`cond`, `case`, ...)

An alternative syntax to describe multiple-choice forms is to use `$` and `?`

    {cond $
       p x ? f x $
       q x ? g x $
       r x ? h x $
         t ? x}

which can be written also as

    {cond $ p x ? f x
          $ q x ? g x
          $ r x ? h x
          $   t ? x}

See [`ordinal` example below](#ordinal).

<a name="Destructuring, multiple values"></a>
### Destructuring, multiple values

Multiple values (`values`) are represented by `.x.`, 
`multiple-value-let` by `=..` , and `destructuring-bind` by `..=`

    '{a (b) c ..= (f x) {a + 1 .x. b + 2 .x. c + 3}}

=>

    (destructuring-bind (a (b) c) (f x) (values (+ a 1) (+ b 2) (+ c 3)))

Another example:

    {{.x. 5 1 5 1} == {a b =.. (truncate 11 2) {.x. a b a b}}}

=> `t`

<a name="Support for macros"></a>
### Support for macros

If BINFIX terms _only_ are inserted under backquote, everything should work
fine, 

    '{let t1 = 'x
          t2 = '{x + x}
         `{x -> ,t1 / ,t2}}

=>

    (let ((t1 'x) (t2 '(+ x x)))
      `(lambda (x) (/ ,t1 ,t2)))

Replacing, however, BINFIX operations inside a backquoted BINFIX will _not_
work.  This is currently not considered as a problem because direct call of
`binfix` will cover some important cases of macro transformations in a 
straightforward manner:

    {m x y :==
       let a = (gensym)
           b = (gensym)
         binfix `(let ,a double-float = ,x
                      ,b double-float = ,y
                    {{,a - ,b} / {,a + ,b}})}

Now macro `m` works as expected:

    (macroexpand-1 '(m (f x y) {a + b}))

=>

    (let ((#:g805 (f x y)) (#:g806 (+ a b)))
      (declare (type double-float #:g806)
               (type double-float #:g805))
      (/ (- #:g805 #:g806) (+ #:g805 #:g806)))
    t

See more in [implementation details](#binfix macros)

<a name="More involved examples"></a>
### More involved examples

<a name="ordinal"></a>
#### `ordinal`

Converting an integer into ordinal string in English can be defined as

    {ordinal i :integer :=
       let* a = {i mod 10}
            b = {i mod 100}
          suf = {cond $ a = b = 1 || a = 1 && 21 <= b <= 91 ? "st"
                      $ a = b = 2 || a = 2 && 22 <= b <= 92 ? "nd"
                      $ a = b = 3 || a = 3 && 23 <= b <= 93 ? "rd"
                      $                                  t  ? "th"}
            format () "~D~a" i suf}

It can be also written in a more "lispy" way without parens as

    {ordinal1 i :integer :=
       let* a = {i mod 10}
            b = {i mod 100}
          suf = {cond $ = a b 1 or = a 1 and <= b 21 91 ? "st"
                      $ = a b 2 or = a 2 and <= b 22 92 ? "nd"
                      $ = a b 3 or = a 3 and <= b 23 93 ? "rd"
                      $                              t  ? "th"}
            format () "~D~a" i suf}

which can be tried using `@.` (`mapcar`)

    {#'ordinal @. '(0 1 12 22 43 57 1901)}

=> `("0th" "1st" "12th" "22nd" "43rd" "57th" "1901st")`

(This example is picked up from [Rust
blog](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/17/Enums-match-mutation-and-moves.html))

<a name="join"></a>
#### `join`

APL-ish joining of things into list:

    {
      defgeneric join (a b) &

      join a :list  b :list :- append a b        &
      join a :t     b :list :- cons a b          &
      join a :list  b :t    :- append a (list b) &
      join a :t     b :t    :- list a b          &

      defbinfix '++ 'join 
    }
    ; Must close here in order to use ++

    {let e = '{2 in 'x ++ '(1 2 3) ++ '((a)) ++ -1 * 2}
        format t "~S~%=> ~S" e (eval e)}

Evaluation of the above returns `t` and prints the following

    (member 2 (join 'x (join '(1 2 3) (join '((a)) (* -1 2)))))
    => (2 3 (a) -2)

<a name="values-bind"></a>
#### `values-bind`

Macro `multiple-value-bind` with symbol `_` in variable list standing for
an ignored value can be defined as

    {values-bind v e &rest r :==
      let*  _ = ()
         vars = {a -> if {a == '_} {car $ push (gensym) _} a @. v}
          `(multiple-value-bind ,vars ,e
              ,@(if _ `({declare $ ignore ,@_}))
              ,@r)}

So, for instance,

    (macroexpand-1 '(values-bind (a _) (truncate 10 3) a))

=>

    (multiple-value-bind (a #:g823) (truncate 10 3) (declare (ignore #:g823)) a)
    t

<a name="for"></a>
#### `for`

Nested BINFIX lambda lists can be used in definitions of macros, as in the
following example of a procedural for loop macro

    {for (v :symbol from below by = 1) &rest r :==
      `(loop for,v fixnum from,from below,below ,@{by /= 1 && `(by,by)}
             do ,@r)}

Now

    (macroexpand-1 '(for (i 0 n) {a ! i .= 1+ i}))

=>

    (loop for i fixnum from 0 below n
          do (setf (aref a i) (1+ i)))
    t

<a name="Implementation"></a>
## Implementation

BINFIX expression is written as a list enclosed in curly brackets `{` ... `}`
handled through LISP reader, so the usual syntax rules of LISP apply, e.g `a+b`
is a single symbol, while `a + b` is three symbols.  Lisp reader after
tokenization calls the function `binfix` which does shallow transformation of
BINFIX into S-expr representation of the expression.

BINFIX uses a simple rewrite algorithm that divides a list in two, LHS and RHS
of the lowest priority infix operator found within the list, then recursively
processes each one.  It also shaves off one level of parens in some cases.

<a name="protoBINFIX"></a>
### protoBINFIX

Bootstraping is done beginning with protoBINFIX,

    (defparameter *binfix*
      '(( &  progn)
        (:== def defmacro)
        (:=  def defun)
        (:-  def defmethod)
        ( =. setq)
        (.=  setf)
        (->  def lambda)
        ($)
        (let  let= let)
        (let* let= let*)
        (cons cons)
        (||   or)
        (&&   and)
        (==   eql)
        (=c=  char=)
        (in   member)
        ( !   aref)))
    
    (defun binfix (e &optional (ops *binfix*))
      (cond ((atom e) e)
            ((null ops) (if (cdr e) e (car e)))
            (t (let* ((op (car ops))
                      (i (position (pop op) e)))
                 (if (null i)
                   (binfix e (cdr ops))
                  `(,@op
                    ,(if (eql (car op) 'def)
                        (subseq e 0 i)
                        (binfix (subseq e 0 i) (cdr ops)))
                    ,(binfix (subseq e (1+ i)) ops)))))))
    
    (set-macro-character #\{
      (lambda (s ch) (declare (ignore ch))
        (binfix (read-delimited-list #\} s t))))
    
    (set-macro-character #\} (get-macro-character #\) ))

which captures the basics of BINFIX.
The next bootstrap phase defines macro `def`,

    (defmacro def (what args body)
      `(,what ,@(if {what == 'lambda}
                  `(,(if {args && atom args} `(,args) args))
                   (if (atom args) `(,args ()) `(,(car args),(cdr args))))
              ,body))

and `let=`,
    
    {let= let nil body &aux vars :==
      loop while {cadr body == '=}
         do (push `(,(car body),(caddr body)) vars)
            {body =. cdddr body}
         finally (return (let ((let `(,let ,(nreverse vars) ,@body)))
                           (if lhs `(,@lhs ,let) let)))}

which wraps up protoBINFIX.

The rest is written using this syntax, and consists of handling of lambda lists
and `lets`, longer list of OPs with properties, redefined `binfix` to
its full capability, and, finally, several convinience functions for
dealing with OPs (`lsbinfix`, `defbinfix` and `rmbinfix`).

Priorities of operations are given only relatively, with no numerical values and
thus with no two operations of the same priority.

<a name="binfix macros"></a>
Since shallow transformation into standard syntax is done by function `binfix`
invoked recursively by the reader, `binfix` cannot be directly called for
arbitrary macro transformation of BINFIX into BINFIX when standard macro
helpers BACKTICK, COMA and COMA-AT are used. The reason is that `{`...`}` is
invoked before them while the correct order would be after them.
Examples of succesful combinations of backquoting and BINFIX are given
[above](#Support for macros).

### Operation properties

`:def` -- Operation (OP) is a definition requiring LHS to has a name and lambda
list.

`:defm` -- OP is a definition requiring LHS to has a name and method lambda
list.

`:lhs-lambda` -- OP has lambda list as its LHS.

`:unreduce` -- All appearances of OP at the current level should be unreduced,
i.e replaced with a single call with multiple arguments.

`:left-assoc` -- OP is left--associative (OPs are right-associative by default.)

`:also-prefix` -- OP can be used as prefix OP when LHS is missing.

`:also-unary` -- OP can be used as unary when LHS is missing.

`:also-postfix` -- OP can be used as postfix OP when RHS is missing.

`:allows-decl` -- OP allows `declare` form(s) at the beginning of its RHS.

`#'my-fun` -- function `my-fun` will be applied to the untransformed RHS.

`:splitter` -- OP splits the expr at this point.

`:rhs-args` -- OP takes LHS as 1st and RHS as remaining arguments.
