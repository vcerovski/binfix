# BINFIX

Viktor Cerovski, Mar 2016.

## Introduction

BINFIX (blend from "Binary Infix") is a poweful infix syntax notation for
S-expressions of Common LISP ranging from simple arithmetic and logical
forms to whole programs.

It is in experimental phase with a few important new features still to come.
One of them, available from v0.16, is use of a single `;` symbol as a
form-separating symbol in [implicit-progn](#LET ; progn example), [expression
terminator](#SETF expr-termination) for SETFs, or as end of [LET binds
symbol](#LET ; examples) or [local functions definition](#Local functions).

The most recent is `def`, for [defining things](#def).

Once the rest of them have been implemented, BINFIX will go to RC and then a
reference 1.0 version.

<a name="Instalation"></a>
## Instalation

[Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/) makes the
downloading/installation/loading trivial:

    (ql:quickload :binfix)

After loading the package, the next step is to allow use of its symbols

    (use-package :binfix)

BINFIX is developed using
[SBCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Bank_Common_Lisp), and checked to
work fine with [CLISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLISP),
and [Clozure CL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozure_CL),
while with [ECL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embeddable_Common_Lisp) BINFIX
passes tests when hand-loaded but does not go through the package system yet.

BINFIX shadows `!` in CLISP (`ext:!`), `@` in Clozure CL and ECL, as well as
`var` (`sb-debug:var`) in SBCL.

The latest version is available at [gihub](https://github.com/vcerovski/binfix),
and can be obtained by

    git clone https://github.com/vcerovski/binfix

<a name="Examples"></a>
## Examples

Generally, quoting a BINFIX expression in REPL will produce the corresponding
S-expression.

For easier comparison of input and output forms in following examples, LISP
printer is first `setq` (operation `=.`) to lowercase output with

    {*print-case* =. :downcase}

=> `:downcase`

BINFIX is a free-form notation (just like S-expr), i.e any number of empty
spaces (including tabs and newlines) between tokens is treated the same as a
single white space.

<a name="Arithmetic and logical expressions"></a>
### Arithmetic and logical expressions

Classic math stuff:

    {2 * 3 + 4}

=> `10`

    '{a * {b + c}}

=> `(* a (+ b c))`

    '{- {x + y} / x * y}

=> `(- (/ (+ x y) (* x y)))`

    '{0 < x < 1 && y >= 1 || y >= 2}

=> `(or (and (< 0 x 1) (>= y 1)) (>= y 2))`

    '{- f x - g x - h x}

=> `(- (- (f x)) (g x) (h x))`

Expressions like `{(f x y) * (g a b)}` and `{{f x y} * {g a b}}` generally
produce the same result. The inner brackets, however, can be removed:

    '{sqrt x * sin x}

=> `(* (sqrt x) (sin x))`

    '{A ! i .= B ! j + C ! k}

=> `(setf (aref a i) (+ (aref b j) (aref c k)))`

    '{a ! i j += b ! i k * c ! k j}

=> `(incf (aref a i j) (* (aref b i k) (aref c k j)))`

    '{listp A && car A == 'x && cdr A || A}

=> `(or (and (listp a) (eql (car a) 'x) (cdr x)) a)`

<a name="Consing"></a>
### Consing

Operation `:.` stands for `cons`. For instance,

    {-2 :. loop for i to 9 collect i}

=> `(-2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)`

with the familiar behaviour:

    {{1 :. 2 :. 3} equal '(1 2 . 3)}

=> `t`

    {{1 :. 2 :. 3 :. {}} equal '(1 2 3)}

=> `t`


<a name="Lambdas, definitions and type annotations"></a>
### Lambdas, definitions and type annotations

<a name="lambda"></a>
#### `lambda`

    '{x -> sqrt x * sin x}

=> `(lambda (x) (* (sqrt x) (sin x)))`

    '{x :single-float -> sqrt x * sin x}

=> `(lambda (x) (declare (type single-float x)) (* (sqrt x) (sin x)))`

    '{x y -> {x - y}/{x + y}}

=> `(lambda (x y) (/ (- x y) (+ x y)))`

Mixing of notations works as well, so each of the following

    {x y -> / (- x y) (+ x y)}
    {x y -> (- x y)/(+ x y)}
    {x y -> (/ (- x y) (+ x y))}

produces the same form.

Fancy way of writing `{2 * 3 + 4}`

    {x -> y -> z -> x * y + z @ 2 @ 3 @ 4}

=> `10`

Quoting reveals the expanded S-expr

    '{x -> y -> z -> x * y + z @ 2 @ 3 @ 4}

=>

    (funcall (funcall (funcall
      (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) (+ (* x y) z))))
        2) 3) 4)

Indeed, `@` is left-associative, standing for `funcall`.

More complicated types can be also explicitely given after the
argument, 

    '{x :|or symbol number| -> x :. x}

=>

    (lambda (x) (declare (type (or symbol keyword) x)) (cons x x))

Mapping is also supported:

    '{x -> sin x * sqrt x @. (f x)}

=>

    (mapcar (lambda (x) (* (sin x) (sqrt x))) (f x))

Alternatively, it is possible to use the form-termination symbol `;`,

    {x -> sin x * sqrt x @. f x;}

to the same effect.

<a name="defun"></a>
#### `defun`

Factorial fun:

    '{f n :integer := if {n <= 0} 1 {n * f {1- n}}}

=>

    (defun f (n)
      (declare (type integer n))
      (if (<= n 0)
          1
          (* n (f (1- n)))))

Function documentation, local declarations, local bindings 
and comments have a straightforward syntax:

    '{g x := "Auxilary fn."
       declare (inline)
       let x*x = x * x; ;; Note binds termination via ;
         x*x / 1+ x*x}

=>

    (defun g (x)
      "Auxilary fn."
      (declare (inline))
      (let ((x*x (* x x)))
        (/ x*x (1+ x*x))))

<a name="&optional"></a>
#### `&optional` is optional

Explicitely tail-recursive version of `f`

    '{fac n m = 1 :=
       declare (integer m n)
       if {n <= 0} m
          {fac {n - 1} {n * m}}}

=>

    (defun fac (n &optional (m 1))
      (declare (integer m n))
      (if (<= n 0)
          m
          (fac (- n 1) (* n m))))

As you may by now expect, the following is also permited

    {fac n :integer m :integer = 1 :=
      if {n <= 0} m
         {fac {n - 1} {n * m}}}

<a name="Local functions"></a>
#### Local functions

Version of `fac` with a local recursive function `f`:

    {fac n :integer :=
      labels
        f n m := {if {n = 0} m
                     {f (1- n) {n * m}}}
       f n 1}

Another syntax to specify a local function is to use a single `;` as in

    {fac n :integer :=
      labels
        f n m := if {n = 0} m
                    {f (1- n) {n * m}};
       f n 1}

<!--
There is also yet another way to write the definition of `fac`, as

    {fac n :integer :=
      labels
        f n m := {if n = 0; m; f (1- n) {n * m}}
       f n 1}
-->

All three above definitions of `fac` are transformed by `binfix` to

    (defun fac (n)
      (declare (type integer n))
      (labels ((f (n m)
                 (if (= n 0)
                     m
                     (f (1- n) (* n m)))))

which can be demonstrated by simply evaluating the quoted expressions.

The same syntax is used also in the case of `flet` and `macrolet`.

<a name="defmethod"></a>
#### `defmethod`

The following generic versions of `f`

    '{f n :integer :- if {n <= 0} 1 {n * f {1- n}}}
    '{f (n integer):- if {n <= 0} 1 {n * f {1- n}}}
<!--
    '{f n :integer :- {if n <= 0; 1;
                          n * f(1- n)}}
-->

all produce

    (defmethod f ((n integer))
      (if (<= n 0)
          1
          (* n (f (1- n)))))

`:-` supports also eql-specialization via `==` op, analogous to
the way `=` is used for optional arguments initialization, as well as an
optional method qualifier, given as the first argument after the method name,
that can be either a keyword or an atom surrounded by parens (i.e `:around`,
`(reduce)` etc.)

<a name="defmacro"></a>
#### `defmacro`

Macros are defined via `:==` operation, similar to the previous examples.
See Sec. [Support for macros](#Support for macros).

<a name="types"></a>
#### Type annotations, declarations and definitions

The examples shown so far demonstrate the possibility to type-annotate
symbols in binds and lambda-lists by an (optional) keyword representing
the type (for instance `:fixnum`, `:my-class`, `:|simple-array single-float|`,
`:|or symbol number|`, `:|{symbol or number}|`, etc.)

OPs that represent LISP forms which allow declaration(s), in BINFIX can 
have in addition to the standard `(declare ...)` form also unparenthesized
variant:

    '{f x :fixnum y = 2 :=
       declare (inline)
       declare (fixnum y)
       x + y ** 2}

=>

    (defun f (x &optional (y 2))
      (declare (type fixnum x))
      (declare (inline))
      (declare (fixnum y))
      (+ x (expt y 2)))

Operation `:->` can be used to specify function type. For example, in
SBCL 1.1.17 function `sin` has declared type that can be written as

    '{number :-> single-float -1.0 1.0 ||
                 double-float -1.0 1.0 ||
                 complex single-float  ||
                 complex double-float .x. &optional}

=>

    (function (number)
     (values
      (or (single-float -1.0 1.0)
          (double-float -1.0 1.0)
          (complex single-float)
          (complex double-float))
      &optional))

Type definitions are given using `:type=` OP, as in

    `{mod n :type= `(integer 0 (,n))}

=>

    (deftype mod (n) `(integer 0 (,n)))

<a name="def"></a>
#### `def`

Program typically consists of a number of definitions of functions,
constants, parameters, types, etc. The operation `def` is introduced
to facilitate their easy writing:

    '{def parameter *x* = 1 *y* = 2
      def struct point x y z
      def f x := sqrt x * sin x}

=>

    (progn
     nil
     (defparameter *x* 1)
     (defparameter *y* 2)
     (defstruct point x y z)
     (defun f (x) (* (sqrt x) (sin x))))

As it is clear from the example, the definitions are wrapped up in `progn`.

More detailed definitions are also straightforward to specify:

    '{def parameter
        *x* :fixnum = 1
        *y* :fixnum = 2

      struct point "Point"
        :print-function {p s d ->
                           declare (ignore d)
                           with-slots (x y z) p
                             (format s "#<~$ ~$ ~$>" x y z)}
        x :single-float = 0f0
        y :single-float = 0f0
        z :single-float = 0f0

      def f x :single-float :=
        declare (inline)
        sqrt x * sin x}

=>

    (progn
     nil
     (declaim (type fixnum *x*)
              (type fixnum *y*))
     (defparameter *x* 1)
     (defparameter *y* 2)
     (defstruct
         (point
          (:print-function
           (lambda (s p d)
             (declare (ignore d))
             (with-slots (x y z)
                 p
               (format s "#<~$ ~$ ~$>" x y z)))))
       "Point"
       (x 0.0 :type single-float)
       (y 0.0 :type single-float)
       (z 0.0 :type single-float))
     (defun f (x)
       (declare (type single-float x)
                (inline))
       (* (sqrt x) (sin x))))

<a name="LETs"></a>
### LETs

LET symbol-binding forms (`let`, `let*` and `symbol-macrolet`) in BINFIX use
`=`  with an optional type-annotation:

    '{let x :bit = 1
          y = {2 ** 3}
          z = 4
        x + y * z}

=>

    (let ((x 1) (y (expt 2 3)) (z 4))
      (declare (type bit x))
      (+ x (* y z)))

<a name="LET ; examples"></a>
A single `;` can be used as a terminator of bindings:

    '{let x :bit = 1
          y = 2 ** 3
          z = f a;
        x + y * z}

=>

    (let ((x 1) (y (expt 2 3)) (z (f a)))
      (declare (type bit x))
      (+ x (* y z)))

<a name="LET ; progn example"></a>
Finally, a single `;` can also be used to separate forms in implicit-progn,
as in

    '{let x :bit = 1
          y = 2 ** 3
          z = f a;         ;; end of binds
        print "Let binds"; ;; 1st form
        x + y * z}         ;; 2nd form of implicit-progn

=>

    (let ((x 1) (y (expt 2 3)) (z (f a)))
      (declare (type bit x))
      (print "Let binds")
      (+ x (* y z)))

<a name="LET associativity"></a>
Nesting of `let`s without parens follows the right-associativity

    '{let a = f x;
        if a
          (g x)
          let b = h x;
            f b}

=>

    (let ((a (f x)))
      (if a
          (g x)
          (let ((b (h x)))
            (f b))))

<a name="SETs"></a>
### SETs

In addition to `=.` and `.=` OPs representing, respectively, a single `setq`
and `setf` assignment, multiple assignments via SETs can be done using `=`,

    '{psetq x =   cos a * x + sin a * y
            y = - sin a * x + cos a * y}

=>

    (psetq x (+ (* (cos a) x) (* (sin a) y))
           y (+ (- (* (sin a) x)) (* (cos a) y)))

and in the case of SETF assignments, RHS are represented with a single
expression,

    '{psetf a ! 0 = {a ! 1}
            a ! 1 = {a ! 0}}

=>

    (psetf (aref a 0) (aref a 1)
           (aref a 1) (aref a 0))

<a name="SETF expr-termination"></a>
Alternatively, it is possible to use a single `;` as an expression-termination
symbol,

    '{psetf a ! 0 = a ! 1; ;; expr. termination via single ;
            a ! 1 = a ! 0}

=>

    (psetf (aref a 0) (aref a 1)
           (aref a 1) (aref a 0))

It is also possible to mix infix SETFs with other expressions:

    '{f x + setf a = b
                 c = d;
          * h a c}

=>

    (+ (f x)
       (*
        (setf a b
              c d)
        (h a c)))

<a name="Implicit progn"></a>
### Implicit `progn`

An implicit `progn` in BINFIX is achieved with a single `;` separating the
forms forming the progn.  In all cases (`->`, `:=`, `:-` and LETs) the syntax
is following that of the [LET example above](#LET ; progn example).

As expected, other `prog`s have to be explicitly given,

    '{x -> prog2 (format t "Calculating... ")
                 {f $ x * x}
                 (format t "done.~%")}

or

    '{x -> prog2
             format t "Calculating... ";
             f {x * x};
             format t "done.~%"}

both producing the following form

    (lambda (x)
      (prog2 (format t "Calculating... ") (f (* x x)) (format t "done.~%")))

Since BINFIX is a free-form notation, the following one-liner also works:

    '{x -> prog2 format t "Calculating... "; f{x * x}; format t "done.~%"}

Binfix `<&` stands for `prog1`,

    '{x -> {f {x * x} <&
            format t "Calculation done.~%"}}

=>

    (lambda (x) (prog1 (f (* x x)) (format t "Calculation done.~%")))

<a name="`$`plitter"></a>
### `$`plitter

Infix `$` is a vanishing OP, leaving only its arguments,
effectivelly splitting the list in two parts.

    '{f $ g $ h x y z}

=> `(f (g (h x y z)))`

So its effect here is similar to `$` in Haskell. 
Or perphaps:

    '{declare $ optimize (speed 1) (safety 1)}

=> `(declare (optimize (speed 1) (safety 1)))`


`$`plitter also allows writing a shorter `cond`, as in

    (cond {p x $ f x}
          {q x $ g x}
          {r x $ h x}
          {t $ x})

compared to the equivalent

    (cond ((p x) (f x))
          ((q x) (g x))
          ((r x) (h x))
          (t x))

Another splitter is `?`, which can be used instead of `$` in the previous
example, as well as described in the next section.

<a name="Multiple-choice forms"></a>
### Multiple-choice forms (`cond`, `case`, ...)

An alternative syntax to describe multiple-choice forms is to use `?` and `;`

    {cond p x ? f x;
          q x ? g x;
          r x ? h x;
            t ? x}

See also [`ordinal` example below](#ordinal).

<a name="Destructuring, multiple values"></a>
### Destructuring, multiple values

Multiple values (`values`) are represented by `.x.`, 
`multiple-value-bind` by `=..` , and `destructuring-bind` by `..=`

    '{a (b) c ..= (f x) a + 1 .x. b + 2 .x. c + 3}

=>

    (destructuring-bind (a (b) c) (f x) (values (+ a 1) (+ b 2) (+ c 3)))

Another way to write the same expr:

    '{a (b) c ..= (f x) values a + 1; b + 2; c + 3}

`multiple-value-call` is represented by `.@.`

    '{#'list .@. 1 '(b 2) 3}

=>

    (multiple-value-call #'list 1 '(b 2) 3)

=>

    (1 (b 2) 3)

<a name="Loops"></a>
#### Loops

Loops can be also nested without writing parens:

    '{loop for i = 1 to 3
           collect loop for j = 2 to 4
                        collect {i :. j}}

=>

    (loop for i = 1 to 3
          collect (loop for j = 2 to 4
                        collect (cons i j))) 

<a name="Support for macros"></a>
### Support for macros

If BINFIX terms _only_ are inserted under backquote, everything should work
fine, 

    '{let t1 = 'x
          t2 = '{x + x}
         `{x -> ,t1 / ,t2}}

=>

    (let ((t1 'x) (t2 '(+ x x)))
      `(lambda (x) (/ ,t1 ,t2)))

Replacing, however, BINFIX operations inside a backquoted BINFIX will _not_
work.  This is currently not considered as a problem because direct call of
`binfix` will cover some important cases of macro transformations in a 
straightforward manner:

    {m x y :==
       let a = (gensym)
           b = (gensym)
         binfix `(let ,a :double-float = ,x
                      ,b :double-float = ,y
                    {,a - ,b} / {,a + ,b})}

Now macro `m` works as expected:

    (macroexpand-1 '(m (f x y) {a + b}))

=>

    (let ((#:g805 (f x y)) (#:g806 (+ a b)))
      (declare (type double-float #:g806)
               (type double-float #:g805))
      (/ (- #:g805 #:g806) (+ #:g805 #:g806)))

#### `ordinal`

Converting an integer into ordinal string in English can be defined as

    {ordinal i :integer :=
       let* a = i mod 10
            b = i mod 100
          suf = {cond
                   a = b = 1 || a = 1 && 21 <= b <= 91 ? "st";
                   a = b = 2 || a = 2 && 22 <= b <= 92 ? "nd";
                   a = b = 3 || a = 3 && 23 <= b <= 93 ? "rd";
                                                    t  ? "th"}
            format () "~D~a" i suf}

It can be also written in a more "lispy" way without parens as

    {ordinal1 i :integer :=
       let* a = i mod 10
            b = i mod 100
          suf = {cond
                   = a b 1 or = a 1 and <= b 21 91 ? "st";
                   = a b 2 or = a 2 and <= b 22 92 ? "nd";
                   = a b 3 or = a 3 and <= b 23 93 ? "rd";
                                                t  ? "th"}
            format () "~D~a" i suf}

which can be tried using `@.` (`mapcar`)

    {#'ordinal @. '(0 1 12 22 43 57 1901)}

=> `("0th" "1st" "12th" "22nd" "43rd" "57th" "1901st")`

blog](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/17/Enums-match-mutation-and-moves.html))

<a name="join"></a>
#### `join`

APL-ish joining of things into list:

    {
      defgeneric join (a b) &

      join a :list  b :list :- append a b        &
      join a :t     b :list :- cons a b          &
      join a :list  b :t    :- append a (list b) &
      join a :t     b :t    :- list a b          &

      defbinfix '++ 'join 
    }
    ; Must close here in order to use ++

    {let e = '{2 in 'x ++ '(1 2 3) ++ '((a)) ++ -1 * 2}
        format t "~S~%=> ~S" e (eval e)}

Evaluation of the above returns `t` and prints the following

    (member 2 (join 'x (join '(1 2 3) (join '((a)) (* -1 2)))))
    => (2 3 (a) -2)

<a name="values-bind"></a>
#### `values-bind`

Macro `multiple-value-bind` with symbol `_` in variable list standing for
an ignored value can be defined as

    {values-bind v e &rest r :==
      let*  _ = ()
         vars = a -> if {a == '_} {car $ push (gensym) _} a @. v;
        `(multiple-value-bind ,vars ,e
            ,@{_ && `({declare $ ignore ,@_})}
            ,@r)}

So, for instance,

    (macroexpand-1 '(values-bind (a _) (truncate 10 3) a))

=>

    (multiple-value-bind (a #:g823) (truncate 10 3) (declare (ignore #:g823)) a)
    t

<a name="for"></a>
#### `for`

Nested BINFIX lambda lists can be used in definitions of macros, as in the
following example of a procedural for-loop macro

    {for (v :symbol from below by = 1) &rest r :==
      `(loop for,v fixnum from,from below,below ,@{by /= 1 && `(by,by)}
             do ,@r)}

Now

    (macroexpand-1 '(for (i 0 n)
                      {a ! i .= 1+ i}))

=>

    (loop for i fixnum from 0 below n
          do (setf (aref a i) (1+ i)))
    t

<a name="Implementation"></a>
## Implementation

BINFIX expression is written as a list enclosed in curly brackets `{` ... `}`
handled through LISP reader, so the usual syntax rules of LISP apply, e.g `a+b`
is a single symbol, while `a + b` is three symbols.  Lisp reader after
tokenization calls the function `binfix` which does shallow transformation of
BINFIX into S-expr representation of the expression.

BINFIX uses a simple rewrite algorithm that divides a list in two, LHS and RHS
of the lowest priority infix operator found within the list, then recursively
processes each one.

<a name="proto-BINFIX"></a>
### proto-BINFIX

Bootstraping is done beginning with proto-BINFIX,

    (defparameter *binfix*
      '(( &  progn)
        (:== def defmacro)
        (:=  def defun)
        (:-  def defmethod)
        ( =. setq)
        (.=  setf)
        (->  def lambda)
        ($)
        (labels flet= labels)
        (let  let= let)
        (let* let= let*)
        (:.   cons)
        (||   or)
        (&&   and)
        (==   eql)
        (=c=  char=)
        (in   member)
        ( !   aref)))
    
    (defun binfix (e &optional (ops *binfix*))
      (cond ((atom e) e)
            ((null ops) (if (cdr e) e (car e)))
            (t (let* ((op (car ops))
                      (i (position (pop op) e)))
                 (if (null i)
                   (binfix e (cdr ops))
                  `(,@op
                    ,(if (eql (car op) 'def)
                        (subseq e 0 i)
                        (binfix (subseq e 0 i) (cdr ops)))
                    ,(binfix (subseq e (1+ i)) ops)))))))
    
    (set-macro-character #\{
      (lambda (s ch) (declare (ignore ch))
        (binfix (read-delimited-list #\} s t))))
    
    (set-macro-character #\} (get-macro-character #\) ))

which captures the basics of BINFIX.

The next bootstrap phase defines macro `def` and, in the same 
single BINFIX expression, macros `let=` and `flet=`

    {defmacro def (what args body)
      `(,what ,@(if {what == 'lambda}
                  `(,(if {args && atom args} `(,args) args))
                   (if (atom args) `(,args ()) `(,(car args),(cdr args))))
              ,body) &

     let= let lhs body &aux vars :==
      loop while {cadr body == '=}
         do {push `(,(car body),(caddr body)) vars &
             body =. cdddr body}
         finally (return (let ((let `(,let ,(nreverse vars) ,@body)))
                           (if lhs `(,@lhs ,let) let))) &

     flet= flet lhs body &aux funs :==
      loop for r = {'= in body} while r
           for (name . lambda) = (ldiff body r)
           do {push `(,name ,lambda ,(cadr r)) funs &
               body =. cddr r}
           finally (return (let ((flet `(,flet ,(nreverse funs) ,@body)))
                             (if lhs `(,@lhs ,flet) flet)))}

which wraps up proto-BINFIX.

Since v0.15, BINFIX interns a symbol consisting of a single `;` char not
followed by `;` char, while two or more consequtive `;` are interpreted
as starting a comment.  This behavior is limited to BINFIX
expressions only, while outside of them the standard LISP rules apply.

Since v0.19, proto-BINFIX introduces `unreduc` property.

The rest is written using this syntax, and consists of handling of lambda lists
and `let`s, a longer list of OPs with properties, redefined `binfix` to
its full capability, and, finally, several interface functions for
dealing with OPs (`lsbinfix`, `defbinfix` and `rmbinfix`).

Priorities of operations are given only relatively, with no numerical values and
thus with no two operations of the same priority.

<a name="binfix macros"></a>
Since shallow transformation into standard syntax is done by function `binfix`
invoked recursively by the reader, `binfix` cannot be directly called for
arbitrary macro transformation of BINFIX into BINFIX when standard macro
helpers BACKTICK, COMA and COMA-AT are used. The reason is that `{`...`}` is
invoked before them while the correct order would be after them.
Examples of succesful combinations of backquoting and BINFIX are given
[above](#Support for macros).

`:def` -- Operation (OP) is a definition requiring LHS to has a name and lambda
list.

`:defm` -- OP is a definition requiring LHS to have a name followed by
unparenthesized method lambda list.

`:lhs-lambda` -- OP has lambda list as its LHS.

`:rhs-lbinds` -- OP has let-binds at the beginning of its LHS,<br>
[*symbol* [*keyword*] **`=`** *expr*]\* *declaration*\*

`:rhs-fbinds` -- OP has flet-binds at the beginning of its LHS, including
optional declarations.

annotations or declarations,
[*symbol* **`=`** *expr*<sup>+</sup>]<sup>+</sup>

`:rhs-ebinds` -- OP has expr-binds at the beginning of its RHS,
[*expr*<sup>+</sup> **`=`** *expr*]\*

`:unreduce` -- All appearances of OP at the current level should be unreduced,
i.e replaced with a single call with multiple arguments.

`:left-assoc` -- OP is left--associative (OPs are right-associative by default.)

`:prefix` -- OP is prefix with RHS being its arguments, given as one or more
atoms/S-expr or a single `;` separated B-expr.

`:also-prefix` -- OP can be used as prefix when LHS is missing.

`:also-unary` -- OP can be used as unary when LHS is missing.

`:also-postfix` -- OP can be used as postfix when RHS is missing.

`:lambda/expr` -- OP takes lambda-list at LHS and an expression at RHS, followed by body.

`:syms/expr` -- OP takes a list of symbols as LHS (each with an optional
[keyword-type](#types) annotation,) an expression as RHS followed
by optional declarations and a BINFIX-expression.

`#'my-fun` -- function `my-fun` will be applied to the untransformed RHS.

`:split` -- OP splits the expr at this point.

`:rhs-args` -- OP takes LHS as 1st and RHS as remaining arguments.

`:macro` -- OP is a macro.
